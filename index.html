        <h3>Planets Discovered over the Years</h3>
        <p>
          In the early years of exoplanet discovery, which began in the 1990s,
          the radial velocity method dominated the field. This method involves
          detecting the gravitational pull of a planet on its parent star,
          causing the star to exhibit a periodic "wobble" in its spectral lines.
          Radial velocity measurements were often carried out using ground-based
          telescopes, and they resulted in the discovery of a substantial number
          of exoplanets, as depicted by a steep rise in the plot during this
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology advanced and space-based telescopes, such as the Kepler
          Space Telescope, became operational, the transit method gained
          prominence. The transit method involves detecting the slight dip in a
          star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it, blocking a
          portion of its light. The plot shows a rapid increase in exoplanet
          discoveries during the years when the transit method was widely used,
          as denoted by a significant spike in the plot.

        <h3>Habitability</h3>
        <p>
          When assessing the habitability of exoplanets, a rudimentary analysis
          often takes into account two key factors: distance from the star and
          stellar effective temperature. These two parameters provide critical
          insights into whether a planet may possess the right conditions to
          support life as we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distance from the star, also known as orbital distance or planetary
          "habitable zone," refers to the region around a star where the
          conditions may be just right for liquid water to exist on the surface
          of a planet. It is considered a crucial factor in determining a
          planet's habitability because water is a fundamental ingredient for
          life as we know it. Planets that are too close to their star may
          experience extreme temperatures, causing water to evaporate or become
          trapped in a gaseous state. On the other hand, planets that are too
          far away may experience freezing temperatures, resulting in water
          being permanently frozen. Therefore, a planet that falls within the
          habitable zone, with an optimal distance from its star, is more likely
          to have conditions suitable for life to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stellar effective temperature, often referred to as the surface
          temperature of a star, is another important factor in determining a
          planet's habitability. The effective temperature of a star influences
          the amount and type of radiation it emits, which in turn affects the
          climate and atmosphere of any planets orbiting it. Stars with higher
          effective temperatures tend to emit more ultraviolet (UV) radiation,
          which can be harmful to life as we know it. On the other hand, stars
          with lower effective temperatures emit less UV radiation, which may be
          conducive to the development of life.

        <h3>Size does matter.</h3>
        <p>
          The comparison of the relative radii of exoplanets to that of Earth
          provides valuable insights into the diverse range of planet sizes that
          have been discovered beyond our solar system. By grouping these
          exoplanets into different ranges based on their size in relation to
          Earth's radius, we can discern patterns and trends that shed light on
          the diversity of planetary compositions in the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          One common way to compare the relative radii of exoplanets to Earth is
          to use Earth's radius as a reference unit, denoted as "RE" (Earth
          radii). Exoplanets can then be classified into different size ranges
          based on their radii in relation to Earth's radius. For instance,
          exoplanets with radii smaller than 1 RE are considered "sub-Earth" or
          "super-Earth" size, as they are smaller or slightly larger than Earth,
          respectively. Exoplanets with radii between 1 RE and 2 RE are often
          classified as "mini-Neptunes," while those with radii larger than 2 RE
          are generally categorized as "gas giants" or "super giants."
