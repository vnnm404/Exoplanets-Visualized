        <h3>Planets Discovered over the Years</h3>
        <p>
          In the early years of exoplanet discovery, which began in the 1990s,
          the radial velocity method dominated the field. This method involves
          detecting the gravitational pull of a planet on its parent star,
          causing the star to exhibit a periodic "wobble" in its spectral lines.
          Radial velocity measurements were often carried out using ground-based
          telescopes, and they resulted in the discovery of a substantial number
          of exoplanets, as depicted by a steep rise in the plot during this
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology advanced and space-based telescopes, such as the Kepler
          Space Telescope, became operational, the transit method gained
          prominence. The transit method involves detecting the slight dip in a
          star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it, blocking a
          portion of its light. The plot shows a rapid increase in exoplanet
          discoveries during the years when the transit method was widely used,
          as denoted by a significant spike in the plot.

        <h3>Hot Jupiters?</h3>
        <p>
          The mass-period exoplanet plot is a graphical representation of the
          relationship between the mass and orbital period of planets outside of
          our solar system. It is a scatter plot where each point represents a
          known exoplanet, and the x-axis represents the orbital period of the
          planet, while the y-axis represents the planet's mass. The plot shows
          that there is a wide range of masses and orbital periods among
          exoplanets, but there are also some patterns that emerge. For example,
          there is a trend for more massive planets to have shorter orbital
          periods, which is known as the <b>"hot Jupiter"</b> phenomenon. There
          are also regions of the plot where few or no exoplanets have been
          detected yet, which may indicate areas that are difficult to observe
          or where planets are less likely to form. Overall, the mass-period
          exoplanet plot provides a useful tool for studying the properties and
          distribution of exoplanets.

        <h3>Basic Habitability</h3>
        <p>
          When assessing the habitability of exoplanets, a rudimentary analysis
          often takes into account two key factors: distance from the star and
          stellar effective temperature. These two parameters provide critical
          insights into whether a planet may possess the right conditions to
          support life as we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distance from the star, also known as orbital distance or planetary
          "habitable zone," refers to the region around a star where the
          conditions may be just right for liquid water to exist on the surface
          of a planet.
          Stellar effective temperature, often referred to as the surface
          temperature of a star, is another important factor in determining a
          planet's habitability. The effective temperature of a star influences
          the amount and type of radiation it emits, which in turn affects the
          climate and atmosphere of any planets orbiting it.

        <h3>This is the heading for the habitability plot</h3>
        <p>
          The comparison of the relative radii of exoplanets to that of Earth
          provides valuable insights into the diverse range of planet sizes that
          have been discovered beyond our solar system. By grouping these
          exoplanets into different ranges based on their size in relation to
          Earth's radius, we can discern patterns and trends that shed light on
          the diversity of planetary compositions in the universe.
