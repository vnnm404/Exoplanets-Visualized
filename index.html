            <h3>Planets Discovered over the Years</h3>
            <p>
              In the early years of exoplanet discovery, which began in the
              1990s, the radial velocity method dominated the field. This method
              involves detecting the gravitational pull of a planet on its
              parent star, causing the star to exhibit a periodic "wobble" in
              its spectral lines. Radial velocity measurements were often
              carried out using ground-based telescopes, and they resulted in
              the discovery of a substantial number of exoplanets, as depicted
              by a steep rise in the plot during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
              As technology advanced and space-based telescopes, such as the
              Kepler Space Telescope, became operational, the transit method
              gained prominence. The transit method involves detecting the
              slight dip in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of
              it, blocking a portion of its light. The plot shows a rapid
              increase in exoplanet discoveries during the years when the
              transit method was widely used, as denoted by a significant spike
              in the plot.

              The exoplanet mass-period plot is a visual representation of the
              correlation between the mass and period of planets beyond our
              solar system. It is a scatter plot where each point corresponds to
              a known exoplanet. The plot illustrates that exoplanets have a
              wide range of masses and periods, and certain patterns can be
              observed, such as the <b>"hot Jupiter"</b> phenomenon where more
              massive planets tend to have shorter periods. The plot also
              reveals regions where exoplanets have not yet been detected, which
              could be due to observational challenges or lower likelihood of
              planet formation. All in all, the mass-period exoplanet plot is a
              valuable tool for analyzing the properties and distribution of
              exoplanets.

              The sky map, also known as the right ascension-declination plot,
              is a graphical representation of the positions of exoplanets on
              the celestial sphere. It shows the locations of exoplanets
              relative to Earth, with each point on the plot representing the
              position of an exoplanet at a specific moment in time. This visual
              tool can be used to identify the location of exoplanets and track
              their movements over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the sky map may reveal patterns and trends in the
              distribution of exoplanets, such as showing that they are more
              likely to be found in certain regions of the sky or that they tend
              to cluster around certain types of stars. As a result, the right
              ascension-declination plot is a useful resource for astronomers
              studying exoplanets and their distribution in the universe.

            <h3>Basic Habitability</h3>
            <p>
              When assessing the habitability of exoplanets, a rudimentary
              analysis often takes into account two key factors: distance from
              the star and stellar effective temperature. These two parameters
              provide critical insights into whether a planet may possess the
              right conditions to support life as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distance from the star, also known as orbital distance or
              planetary "habitable zone," refers to the region around a star
              where the conditions may be just right for liquid water to exist
              on the surface of a planet. Stellar effective temperature, often
              referred to as the surface temperature of a star, is another
              important factor in determining a planet's habitability. The
              effective temperature of a star influences the amount and type of
              radiation it emits, which in turn affects the climate and
              atmosphere of any planets orbiting it.

            <h3>Habitability Zone Plot</h3>
            <p>
              A habitable zone plot for exoplanets is a graphical representation
              of the range of distances from a star where a planet could
              potentially have liquid water on its surface, which is a key
              factor for supporting life as we know it. The plot typically shows
              the habitable zone as a colored band, with the inner and outer
              edges of the band corresponding to the limits where water would be
              too hot or too cold to exist in a liquid state. The habitable zone
              depends on various factors, such as the star's size, temperature,
              and luminosity, as well as the planet's size and atmospheric
              composition. By plotting the habitable zone, scientists can
              identify exoplanets that are more likely to harbor life and
              prioritize their observations for further study.
            </p>
            <p>
              By plotting the habitable zone for exoplanets, astronomers can
              identify planets that are situated at the right distance from
              their host star to have the potential for the existence of liquid
              water on their surface. These planets are more likely to have
              conditions suitable for life as we know it, and further studies
              can be focused on these planets to search for signs of life.

            <h3>ESI plot</h3>
            <p>
              The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) plot is a graphical
              representation of the similarity between exoplanets and Earth. It
              is a scatter plot where each point represents a known exoplanet,
              and the x-axis represents the planet's ESI value, which is a
              measure of how similar the planet is to Earth in terms of
              temperature, mass, and atmospheric composition. The y-axis
              represents some other relevant factor, such as the planet's size
              or distance from its host star.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plot allows astronomers to compare exoplanets to Earth in
              terms of their potential habitability, as planets with higher ESI
              values are considered more Earth-like and therefore more likely to
              support life. The ESI plot can also reveal patterns and trends in
              the distribution of potentially habitable exoplanets, such as
              showing that they are more likely to be found around certain types
              of stars or in certain regions of the galaxy.

          <p>
            "Teegarden's Star B" is a hypothetical exoplanet that is believed to
            orbit Teegarden's Star, a red dwarf located about 12.5 light-years
            away from Earth in the constellation Aries. Teegarden's Star B is
            considered to be a potentially habitable planet, meaning that it may
            have the right conditions to support liquid water on its surface and
            potentially even life as we know it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teegarden's Star B was first detected in 2019 using the CARMENES
            spectrograph, which is designed to detect small, rocky planets
            orbiting nearby stars. Based on its mass and distance from its star,
            Teegarden's Star B is believed to be a rocky planet with a surface
            temperature that could support liquid water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Teegarden's Star B is considered a prime candidate for
            further study, it has not yet been directly observed or confirmed,
            and its existence remains hypothetical. Nonetheless, its discovery
            highlights the potential for finding potentially habitable worlds
            around nearby stars, and the continuing search for exoplanets that
            could support life beyond our solar system.

            <h3>The Full Systems.</h3>
            <p>
              A visualization of two solar systems containing Earth and
              Teegarden's Star B would show two distinct planetary systems
              orbiting their respective stars. The first system would feature
              our own solar system, with the familiar rocky planets Mercury,
              Venus, Earth, and Mars orbiting around the Sun, as well as the gas
              giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune further out. The
              second system would show Teegarden's Star, a much smaller and
              cooler red dwarf star, with Teegarden's Star B orbiting much
              closer in than any planet in our solar system. The visualization
              would likely depict Teegarden's Star B as a rocky, Earth-like
              planet, potentially with oceans and a thick atmosphere, depending
              on its exact properties. Overall, the visualization would
              highlight the diversity of planetary systems that exist in our
              galaxy and beyond, and the potential for finding other habitable
              worlds beyond our own.
