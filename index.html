            <h3>Planets Discovered over the Years</h3>
            <p>
              In the early years of exoplanet discovery, which began in the
              1990s, the radial velocity method dominated the field. This method
              involves detecting the gravitational pull of a planet on its
              parent star, causing the star to exhibit a periodic "wobble" in
              its spectral lines. Radial velocity measurements were often
              carried out using ground-based telescopes, and they resulted in
              the discovery of a substantial number of exoplanets, as depicted
              by a steep rise in the plot during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
              As technology advanced and space-based telescopes, such as the
              Kepler Space Telescope, became operational, the transit method
              gained prominence. The transit method involves detecting the
              slight dip in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of
              it, blocking a portion of its light. The plot shows a rapid
              increase in exoplanet discoveries during the years when the
              transit method was widely used, as denoted by a significant spike
              in the plot.

              The mass-period exoplanet plot is a graphical representation of
              the relationship between the mass and orbital period of planets
              outside of our solar system. It is a scatter plot where each point
              represents a known exoplanet, and the x-axis represents the
              orbital period of the planet, while the y-axis represents the
              planet's mass. The plot shows that there is a wide range of masses
              and orbital periods among exoplanets, but there are also some
              patterns that emerge. For example, there is a trend for more
              massive planets to have shorter orbital periods, which is known as
              the <b>"hot Jupiter"</b> phenomenon. There are also regions of the
              plot where few or no exoplanets have been detected yet, which may
              indicate areas that are difficult to observe or where planets are
              less likely to form. Overall, the mass-period exoplanet plot
              provides a useful tool for studying the properties and
              distribution of exoplanets.

              The right ascension - declination plot, also known as the sky map,
              is a graphical representation of the positions of exoplanets on
              the celestial sphere. Right ascension (RA) is the equivalent of
              longitude on the celestial sphere, while declination (Dec) is the
              equivalent of latitude.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plot shows the positions of exoplanets in the sky relative to
              Earth, with RA on the x-axis and Dec on the y-axis. Each point on
              the plot represents the position of an exoplanet at a specific
              moment in time. The plot can be used to identify the location of
              exoplanets and to track their movements over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plot can also reveal patterns and trends in the distribution
              of exoplanets. For example, it may show that exoplanets are more
              likely to be found in certain regions of the sky, or that they
              tend to cluster around certain types of stars. Overall, the right
              ascension - declination plot is a useful tool for astronomers
              studying exoplanets and their distribution in the universe.

            <h3>Basic Habitability</h3>
            <p>
              When assessing the habitability of exoplanets, a rudimentary
              analysis often takes into account two key factors: distance from
              the star and stellar effective temperature. These two parameters
              provide critical insights into whether a planet may possess the
              right conditions to support life as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distance from the star, also known as orbital distance or
              planetary "habitable zone," refers to the region around a star
              where the conditions may be just right for liquid water to exist
              on the surface of a planet. Stellar effective temperature, often
              referred to as the surface temperature of a star, is another
              important factor in determining a planet's habitability. The
              effective temperature of a star influences the amount and type of
              radiation it emits, which in turn affects the climate and
              atmosphere of any planets orbiting it.

              The comparison of the relative radii of exoplanets to that of
              Earth provides valuable insights into the diverse range of planet
              sizes that have been discovered beyond our solar system. By
              grouping these exoplanets into different ranges based on their
              size in relation to Earth's radius, we can discern patterns and
              trends that shed light on the diversity of planetary compositions
              in the universe.
